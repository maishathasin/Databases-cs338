- Assign tasks to members, monitor them to complete their tasks, and report their progress at all times.
- According to the rubric's requirements of Milestone 1, I completed most of the SQL coding.
- Integrated and made a website page for posting jobs and applying for jobs to interact with customers by writing code, based on ideas discussed with team members.
- Reviewed team members' work and discussed with them to make changes.
- Created various scripts to upload the data and added most functionalities/features.
- For Milestone 2, actively discussed features with team members and introduced Svelte and its components to build a nice front-end.
  - Decided to add a register/login page and a “see more” button for each job to hide large sections of the job description, which will appear when the button is pressed.
  - Implemented a new search function with a typing bar and a “search icon” button in the top left corner of the interface. This allows users to search by job name and corresponding company name, displaying all jobs that include the searched term.
  - Colored all the “see all” and “Apply” buttons black to create a simple but modern look that complements the white background.
  - Walked the other members through what to implement and how to navigate the frontend framework.

  - Meticulously revised our database structure for Milestone 2, discussing potential changes with team members and implementing new entities and relationships.
  - Redistributed and refined attributes across entities to ensure our tables were optimized and compliant with the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), thereby enhancing database performance and integrity.
- Collaborated with Maisha to develop the front end of our interface using Svelte, contributing to a user-friendly and functional application interface that facilitates easy interaction with our database.

**Yizhou Shan**

- Leveraged deep understanding of database systems to conduct extensive research online, ultimately identifying and selecting an optimal database solution that meets our project requirements.
- Initiated the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and relational data model tailored for job postings, laying the foundational structure for our database design.
- Implemented significant modifications to the format of our final report, enhancing its clarity and alignment with academic standards and project objectives.
- For Milestone 2, meticulously digitized the hand-drawn ER diagram and relational model created by Sadequa Nusrat using Lucidchart.
  - Crafted a precise and detailed electronic version of our database design.
  - Collaborated with Sadequa Nusrat to review and refine this digital version, ensuring accuracy and coherence by correcting any identified discrepancies together.
- Worked with team members to modify the format of the milestone as well as add new content and highlight them.
